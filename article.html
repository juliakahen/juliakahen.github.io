      <p>The year 2020 had consequences that spread far beyond the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that the number of reported hate crimes in 2020 was the highest number in two decades.</p>

      <p>Hate crimes will always be a part of society. It is in human nature to have stigmas against certain groups and unfortunately, some people will act against others purely based on their identities.</p>

      <p>The United States is home to people from across the globe: People with different religious beliefs, skin colors, customs, traditions and sexual orientations. Approximately 332 million people live in the U.S. 20 million of those people live in the state of New York.</p>

      <p>So, how have hate crimes affected New Yorkers over time? More specifically, how has the arrival COVID-19 in the year 2020 skewed hate crimes in New York? Let’s take a look.</p>

      <p>Hate crimes from 2010-2020 occurred in nearly all of the 62 counties in New York. The counties surrounding New York City had a higher concentration of hate crimes compared to other counties in the state. 
</p>


      <p>Liwu Gan is faculty fellow at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. With her PhD in Political Science, Gan’s specialty is in the International Relations field. Her focus is on how to make the distribution of refugees around the world more fair. She has studied how countries, including the United States, treat people from different backgrounds.</p>

      <p>“The hate crimes are going to cluster in the more densely populated areas most of the time. That is expected,” said Gan.

</script>

      <p>Over this 10 year period, the counties whose populations were affected the most by hate crimes were New York, Queens, Suffolk, Westchester and Bronx. When comparing the number of victims to the population of each county, these five counties yielded the highest percentages of people who were victims of hate crimes. New York County led with 1.51 percent of its population being a victim of a hate crime from 2010-2020. 
</p>

      <p>When focusing on the year 2020, counties around New York still had a higher concentration of hate crimes. However, there were more outliers in counties throughout upstate New York. Hate crimes in 2020 were less evenly dispersed throughout the state, when compared to the data from throughout the 10 years.  </p>

      <iframe title="Hate Crimes across New York in 2020" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-H3Hrg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/H3Hrg/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="608" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>The county with the highest percentage of victims of hate crimes in 2020 was Queens County, at 0.12 percent. Following Queens was New York, Westchester, Bronx and Richmond (Staten Island). Counties such as Monroe and Clinton also had comparable percentages of people affected by hate crimes. </p>

        <p>There were five hate crimes whose number of victims in New York state showed significant changes in 2020. Those were anti-Jewish, anti-Asian, anti-Black, anti-White and anti-Gay hate crimes.</p>

        <iframe title="Hate Crime Incidents in New York State" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XN2ed" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XN2ed/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="450" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>While anti-Jewish, anti-Gay and anti-White hate crimes yielded significant decreases in incidents in 2020, anti-Asian and anti-Black hate crimes yielded significant increases. These specific changes correlate to the arrival of COVID-19, also in 2020. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recorded a 77 percent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes from 2019 to 2020 in the United States. In the state of New York, there was a shocking 520 percent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes from 2019-2020. This anti-Asian hate was likely due to the fact that the first COVID-19 cases were reported in China, as well as former President Donald Trump’s blame on China for the spread of the virus. </p>

        <p>There was a 40 percent increase in anti-Black hate crimes in the United States in 2020 compared to the previous year. Although the spike was not as high as anti-Asian hate crimes, it is still significant. The increase in anti-Black hate crimes in New York in 2020 was higher than that of the country, at 45 percent. This increase may be due to the boom in “Black Lives Matter” protests, starting in March 2020, over the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.</p>

        <p>In May 2021, President Biden signed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act in an attempt to stop the rise in hate crimes during the pandemic, specifically towards Asian people.</p>

        <p>Hate crimes in New York were committed both against people and against property in 2020. Below shows the breakdown of each type of hate crime for the five groups in 2020 that yielded the most significant changes in incidents.</p>

        <iframe title="Type of hate crime by percent in 2020 in NY" aria-label="Multiple Pies" id="datawrapper-chart-Da0Em" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Da0Em/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="394" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<iframe title="Type of hate crime by percent from 2010-2020 in NY" aria-label="Multiple Pies" id="datawrapper-chart-PbXa5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PbXa5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="394" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>Although anti-Jewish hate crimes have decreased by 45 percent from 2019 to 2020, Jewish people were still the group most targeted in New York in 2020. 74 percent of anti-Jewish crimes in 2020 were property crimes, which includes burglary, larceny and vandalism. Anti-Gay, Anti-Asian and Anti-White crimes, on the other hand, were for mostly committed against people instead of property. Anti-Black crimes were almost evenly split.</p>

        <p>Although the number of victims of hate crimes yielded notable changes in 2020, the percentages of the type of hate crime - property crimes or crimes against persons - did not change as significantly in 2020 when compared to the 10-year total. Each group compared above was impacted with a similar proportion of crime type in 2020 than in the years prior. This was one aspect of hate crimes that remained relatively constant in the year 2020 in New York.</p>

        <p>The year 2020 had an extremely notable effect on the number of victims affected by hate crimes, not just in the state of New York, but across the nation. Most of the hate crimes in New York occurred within New York City and the counties surrounding the city, likely due to more diversity and a higher population. COVID-19 was not the only change that New Yorkers experienced in 2020.
